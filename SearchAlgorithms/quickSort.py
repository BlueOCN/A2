    Quicksort Algorithm
    Based on the book "Essential Algorithms" by Rod Stephens

    The quicksort algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It subdivides an array 
    into two pieces and then calls itself recursively to sort the pieces.

from typing import Iterable, Tuple


def main():
    data = [6,2,8,9,5,7,3,1,4,10]
    print(data)
    quickSort(data,0,len(data)-1)
    print(data)

def quickSort(data: Iterable, start: int, end: int)->Iterable:
    """
        Next the algorithm uses variables lo and hi to hold the highest index in the 
        lower part of the array and the lowest index in the upper part of the array. It 
        uses those variables to keep track of which items it has placed in the two halves. 
        Those variables also alternately track where the hole is left after each step.
        The algorithm then enters an infinite While loop that continues until the lower 
        and upper pieces of the array grow to meet each other.
        Inside the outer While loop, the algorithm starts at index hi and searches 
        the array backward until it finds an item that should be in the lower piece of the 
        array. It moves that item into the hole left behind by the dividing item.
        Next the algorithm starts at index lo and searches the array forward until it 
        finds an item that should be in the upper piece of the array. It moves that item 
        into the hole left behind by the previously moved item.
        The algorithm continues searching backward and then forward through the 
        array until the two pieces meet. At that point, it puts the dividing item between 
        the two pieces and recursively calls itself to sort the pieces
